# 🌟 Feature Ideas Board

Hey everyone! 👋  

Welcome to the **_5D Chess (Flutter Edition)_ Feature Board** — a space where we can brainstorm, discuss, and propose new ideas for the project together.  

If you’ve got an idea — big or small — drop it here!  
Whether it’s a gameplay tweak, UI improvement, accessibility option, or just a “wouldn’t it be cool if…?” thought — all suggestions are welcome.  

💡 **How to contribute:**
- Add your feature below under a new bullet point.  
- Keep it short but clear (e.g., “Add board zooming with pinch gestures”).  
- If it’s complex, feel free to start a discussion or issue for it.  

Let’s build this together — one timeline at a time 🕰️♟️
